    "* Students should be able to describe their findings, translate results from code to text using Markdown comments in the Jupyter Notebook, and summarize their thought process in a narrative\n",
    "* Students should be able to modify the raw data to prepare a clean data set -- including copying data, removing or replacing missing and incoherent data, dropping columns, removing duplicates in Pandas and Jupyter -- and explain and justify their decisions in markdown in their Jupyter notebook\n",
    "* Students should be able to assess whether their data is “Tidy” and identify appropriate steps and write and  execute code to arrange it into a tidy format - including merging, reshaping, subsetting, grouping, sorting, making appropriate new columns  - and explain and justify their decisions in markdown in their Jupyter notebook\n",
    "* Students should be able to identify several relevant summary measures, illustrate data using appropriate plots, and explain and justify their decisions in markdown in their Jupyter notebook\n",
    "* Student should assess the summaries and plots and appraise the need for repeated or further analysis, and justify decisions in markdown\n"
